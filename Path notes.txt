version 0.2.0
Huge update!
-Program execution time for one year is now around 1000sec, down from 3000/5000 sec for one year (each subsequent year the slowdown increases exponentially).
The reason is the program no longer creates a giant dataframe in itself. The program now creates smaller parts which are easier to manage.
ADDED:
calculate_years_between()
-Function is responsible for caculate number of years beetwen two dates.
marge_csv_files()
-Function performs final dataframe with all records from chosen year. I will add it in the next version possibility to delate files.

version 0.1.0
Shortened scrap_and_convert_into_csv() execution time by adding comprehension into merge_lists() instead of normal loop.
